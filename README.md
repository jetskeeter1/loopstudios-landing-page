## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![Hero-banner-finish](/process%20image/hero-nav.png)
the use of sass really made it more compact and easier to know where and what is going on inside my code. The way on how I made my the banner is the use of the br element or break line tag and resize the billboard-hero and font-is-v-large which got the result I wanted.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Sass](https://www.sass-lang.com)

### What I learned

I love the using Sass, I learn to be a bit more organized with the way how I do things using nesting. It definitly got eaiser to do css and I did things a lot quicker than before where I have to look very intensively just to find where the css is located in the file.

### Continued development

I will continue to learn how I can be more organize using [Sass](https://www.sass-lang.com) and learn through the documentation of what I can do like using nest, mixin, and others that I have not used.
