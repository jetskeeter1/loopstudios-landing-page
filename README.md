## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![Hero-banner-finish](images/process%20image/hero-nav.png)
the use of sass really made it more compact and easier to know where and what is going on inside my code. The way on how I made my the banner is the use of the br element or break line tag and resize the billboard-hero and font-is-v-large which got the result I wanted.

![Lead-article](images/process%20image/main-lead-article.png)
This is done quite easily know that I have to add on main a margin of 104px and that the lead container would squish the inside content and suprisingly got almost exactly the same the first time.

![footer-finish-all-active-state](image/process%20image/website-interactivity.png)
the see all button and grid item active state was not too hard and with the help of sass did made it easier to make it. The trouble I had with is the links with border bottom, the solution that I find is the use of pseudo code and manipulate its position's absolute that is relative to its parent container. You can find this under .media-list, .nav-list, and .footer-list. The names are weird, but I just stuck to it.

![mobile-version](image/process%20image/mobile-finish.png)
This is a finish where I did a lot of changes like its background images, positioning of each of the elements in the main and footer. I did some changes to the footer so that I would be able to make the footer close to the preview image as much as possible. Lastly, I create the drop-down sidebar along with transition for easy smooth animation from drop down from the top to show the list of links.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Sass](https://www.sass-lang.com)

### What I learned

I love the using Sass, I learn to be a bit more organized with the way how I do things using nesting. It definitly got eaiser to do css and I did things a lot quicker than before where I have to look very intensively just to find where the css is located in the file.

I also learn that I need to take advantage of the pseudo code more often when it comes to have effects on an elements itself. I would love to learn more about different methods regarding pseudo code effects.

### Continued development

I will continue to learn how I can be more organize using [Sass](https://www.sass-lang.com) and learn through the documentation of what I can do like using nest, mixin, and others that I have not used.
